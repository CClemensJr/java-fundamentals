# Lab 03: Maps, File I/O, and Testing
> For the first two methods in today’s lab, continue working in your basiclibrary directory. For the JS linter, create a new Java application by creating a new directory called linter, cding into it, and running gradle init --type java-application. Download the gates.js file, and save it in a resources directory within the linter directory.

## Feature Tasks
### Analyzing Weather Data
> Use the October Seattle weather data above. Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values. Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min temp to the max temp and create a String containing any temperature not seen during the month. Return that String.

### Tallying Election
> Write a function called tally that accepts a List of Strings representing votes and returns one string to show what got the most votes.

### JavaScript Linter
> Write a method that reads a JavaScript file with a given Path, and prints an error whenever it finds a line that doesn’t end in a semi-colon.
